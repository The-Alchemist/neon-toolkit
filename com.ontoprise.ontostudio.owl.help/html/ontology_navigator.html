<h4>Ontology Navigator</h4>
<p>The Ontology Navigator displays the different OWL ontology projects and their corresponding ontologies.
You are able to navigate within the hierarchically arranged elements. Furthermore, you can create, change
and delete ontology elements. The different possibilities to edit the elements are listed in the appropriate
context menu.</p> 
<p><img class="format" src="../images/screenshots/owl1.jpg" title="OWL navigator" alt="OWL navigator"></p>
<p>To open the context menu of an element, click on the element using the right mouse button. If an element 
contains further sub-elements, then a plus sign is displayed on the left side of the element. Please click on this
plus sign to expand the sub-elements. In order to close the view of the sub-elements, click on the minus sign beside
the upper element.</p>
<p>Many nodes that are displayed in this tree can be dragged-and-dropped in order to modify the hierarchical structure
of the ontology. For example, a class can be moved to a new superclass by simply dragging it to the new location.
When holding the Ctrl key and dragging a node then, you will see the mouse cursor change to contain a little "+" icon. 
When dropping an entity it will not be moved to the new location but it will be <i>copied</i> there, usually resulting
in additional <tt>subClassOf</tt> or <tt>subPropertyOf</tt> axioms.</p>
<p>Within an OWL project the Ontology Navigator hosts different types of entities. When selecting one of the nodes,
the corresponding Entity Property panel will display the details of the recently selected entity. The Ontology Navigator
hosts the following types of entities:</p> 
<ul>
    <li><a href="owl_ontology.html"><b>OWL Ontology</b></a></li>
    <li><a href="owl_classes.html"><b>OWL Class</b></a></li>
    <li><a href="owl_object_properties.html"><b>Object Property</b></a></li>
    <li><a href="owl_data_properties.html"><b>Datatype Property</b></a></li>
    <li><a href="owl_annotation_properties.html"><b>Annotation Property</b></a></li>
    <li><a href="owl_datatypes.html"><b>Datatype</b></a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h5>Ontology Visualizer</h5>

<p>
The "Ontology Graph Visualize View" displays the ontology and all elements of the hierarchy (classes, individuals, object properties) in a graph. 
You can open the view by selecting "Show in Visualizer" in the context menu of an ontology element or a class element in the tree menu.

<b>Functions:</b>
<ul>
<li>Display of classes, individuals and inhertitage hierarchy by directed graphs</li>
<li>Display of object properties, data properties and values by directed graphs</li>
<li>Zoom function</li>
<li>Rotation function</li>
<li>Automatic layout for optimized view of the graph</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Tip &ndash;</b> Left-clicking an element in the Ontology Visualizer will refresh the visualization rendering with 
the currently selected element becoming its center. By right-clicking an element all of its connections will be appended 
to the current visualization without shifting the focus to this element.
<hr>  

<b>Legend:</b>


<p>On the left side of the view a legend is displayed.
 Here you can activate or deactivate different ontology 
 entities by selecting the checkboxes. </p>
<p>You can also enlarge or reduce the view of the graph. This can be achieved by changing the zoom value or by pressing Ctrl + 
to zoom in and Ctrl - to zoom out.</p>
<b>Graph elements:</b>

<p>Grey arrows:<br>
Represent the connection between super and subclasses or super class and ontology root.</p>

<p>Green arrows:<br>
Represent the connection between individuals and object properties.
</p>
<p>Blue arrows:<br>
Represent the connection between classes and individuals, individuals and object properties, individuals and data properties.
</p>
<hr>
<b>Note &ndash;</b> The appearance of graph elements depends on the ontology language selected (F-Logic, RDF or OWL).
