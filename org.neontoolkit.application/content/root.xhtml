          </p>
<!--          <p>The NeOn toolkit is part of the reference implementation of the NeOn architecture. It
          is based on the Ontology Engineering Environment OntoStudio (c). In contains plug-ins for
          ontology management and visualization. The core features include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic Modeling of OWL-2 ontologies</li>
            <li>Browsing and visualizing</li>

		  The <a href="http://neon-toolkit.org/wiki/Main_Page">NeOn Toolkit</a> is a state-of-the-art, 
		  open source multi-platform ontology engineering environment, which provides comprehensive 
		  support for the ontology engineering life-cycle. 
		  The NeOn Toolkit was originally developed in the context of the EU-funded FP6 NeOn project 
		  and it is now distributed and supported by the NeOn Foundation.

          <p>
          The <a href="http://www.neon-project.org">NeOn Project</a> (2006-2010) involved 14 European partners and was co-funded by the European 
          Commission's Sixth Framework Programme under grant number IST-2005-027595. NeOn has developed 
          a variety of methods and technologies to advance the state of the art in the use of ontologies, 
          in particular in the context of semantic web applications. Highlights include methods and 
          tools for managing networks of ontologies, ontology alignment, modularisation, ontology 
          evolution, inconsistency resolution, reuse of ontological and non-ontological resources, 
          navigation and visualisation, to mention just a few. All these technologies are integrated 
          and accessible within the NeOn Toolkit and provide concrete technological support for the NeOn 
          Methodology, a pragmatic handbook-style set of guidelines to guide ontology engineers.
