<h4>OWL Classes</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, OWL classes can be considered as sets of individuals that share similar characteristics.
These classes are organized in hierarchies, of which <tt>owl:Thing</tt> is the root class. Every individual
in the ontology is a member of the class <tt>owl:Thing</tt>. Thus, each class you create is implicitly a subclass
of <tt>owl:Thing</tt>. A class may be a subclass of more than one parent class. Likewise, an individual may belong
to more than one class.</p>
<p>OWL classes are described through so-called class descriptions. A class description describes an OWL class,
either by a class name or by specifying the complex class expression, representing an unnamed anonymous class. 
OWL distinguishes six types of class descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class identifiers (a URI reference)</li>
<li>Exhaustive enumeration of individuals that together form the instances of a class
<li>Restrictions</li>
<li>Intersection of two or more class descriptions</li>
<li>Union of two or more class descriptions</li>
<li>Complement of a class description</li>
</ul> 

<p>These class descriptions are distributed over the following tabs in the Entity Properties panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Class Restrictions.</b> Unnamed classes that are defined based on restrictions on the values for particular
properties of the class.</li>
<li><b>Taxonomy.</b> All super classes, subclasses, equivalent classes and disjoint classes of the selected class.</li>
<li><b>Annotations.</b> OWL allows classes, properties, individuals, and the ontology itself 
to be annotated with readable labels, comments, or other useful information.</li> 
</ul>

<h5>Class Restrictions</h5>
<p>
OWL can be used to model situations in which the members of a particular class must have certain properties. You can 
use various restriction statements to indicate that something should apply to all values of a property versus only 
for some members. 
In addition, you can even specify a particular value for a property of all members of a class. </p>

<p>OWL distinguishes two kinds of restrictions: value restrictions and cardinality restrictions. 
A value restriction puts constraints on the range of the property when applied to this particular class. 
A cardinality restrictions puts constraints on the number of values the property can take, 
in the context of this particular class.</p>
<p>OWL provides the following value restrictions:
<ul>
<li><tt>owl:allValuesFrom</tt> (<tt>ALL</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>owl:someValuesFrom</tt> (<tt>SOME</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>owl:hasValue</tt> (<tt>HAS_VALUE</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>owl:hasSelf</tt> (<tt>HAS_SELF</tt>)</li>
</ul>
In addition, OWL provides the following cardinality restrictions:
<ul>
<li><tt>owl:maxCardinality</tt> (<tt>AT_MOST/MAX</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>owl:minCardinality</tt> (<tt>AT_LEAST/MIN</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>owl:cardinality</tt> (<tt>EXACTLY/CARD</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Class restrictions can either be specified as Super Restrictions or Equivalent Restrictions. If you add
the class restriction in the Super Restriction section, the class under consideration will become a subclass
of the restriction class (i.e. you define a <i>necessary condition</i> for the class). 
On the other hand, if you add the class restriction in the Equivalent Restrictions section, 
both, the restriction class and the restricted class, will be interpreted as equivalent, which means that 
they always have exactly the same members (i.e. you define a <i>necessary and sufficient</i> condition for the class).</p>
<p>For instructions on how to create a class, see 
<a href="create_class.html">Create a Class</a>. To create a class restriction, proceed as follows. </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Select a class in the Ontology Navigator.</b><br>
The class will be displayed in the Entity Properties panel.</li> 
<li><b>Enter a property.</b><br>
Enter the property used to restrict the class. You can also use the auto-complete feature of the OWL Perpective.</li>
<li><b>Select a quantifier.</b><br>
Select the appropriate value constraint or cardinality constraint.</li>
<li><b>(Optional) Select a number.</b><br>
This only applies if you have selected a cardinality constraint.</li> 
<li><b>Select a range.</b><br>
Select the class for which the property under consideration only should have values.</li>
<li><b>Click Add.</b><br>
The class restriction will be created. To discard your changes, click Cancel.</li>  
</ol>

<hr><b>Note &ndash;</b> The ranges of restrictions can be entered using the Manchester OWL Syntax. For more information, see
<a href="manchester_syntax.html">Manchester Syntax</a>.<hr>


<h5>Taxonomy</h5>
<p>On this tab you can define classes through class axioms. The simplest form of a class axiom is a class description
of type 1 above. It just states the existence of a class, using <tt>owl:Class</tt> with a class identifier.
Class axioms typically contain additional components that state necessary and/or sufficient characteristics
of a class. OWL contains three language constructs for combining class descriptions into class axioms:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Subclasses.</b> The OWL language construct <tt>rdfs:subClassOf</tt> allows you to say that a class
is a subset of another class.</li>
<li><b>Equivalent Classes.</b> The OWL language construct <tt>owl:equivalentClass</tt> allows you to 
say that a class has exactly the same members as another class.</li>
<li><b>Disjoint Classes.</b> The OWL language construct <tt>owl:disjointWith</tt> allows you to say 
that a class has no members in common with another class.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these language constructs, the OWL Perpective allows you to specify the <b>super classes</b> of a
class, which is the same as making the class under consideration a subclass of another (parent) class.
For example, you will notice that <tt>owl:Thing</tt> is the super class of all other classes because
every user-defined class is implicitly a subclass of <tt>owl:Thing</tt>.</p>

<p>To create a class axiom, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Select a class in the Ontology Navigator.</b><br>
The class will be displayed in the Entity Properties panel.</li> 
<li><b>Go to the Taxonomy tab.</b><br>
The class axioms will be displayed.</li>
<li><b>Create a class axiom.</b><br>
In the Create New text box, enter a class name. 
You can also use the auto-complete feature of the OWL Perpective. In addition to simple
classes you can also enter complex class descriptions using the <a href="manchester_syntax.html">Manchester Syntax</a>.</li> 
<li><b>Click Add.</b><br>
The class axiom will be created. To discard your changes, click Cancel.</li>  
</ol>
<h5>Annotations</h5>
<p>Usually, annotations are used to add information to resources of the ontology. They contain useful information such
as who is the creator or what are the readable labels and comments for single elements of the ontology.</p>
<p>For information on how to create an annotation, see <a href="create_annotation.html">Create an Annotation</a>.</p>
