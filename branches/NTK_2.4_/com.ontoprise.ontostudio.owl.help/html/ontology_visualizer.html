<h4>Ontology Visualizer</h4>

<p>
The Ontology Visualizer Panel displays the ontology and all elements of the hierarchy 
(classes, individuals, object properties) as a graph. 
You can open the view by selecting "Visualize Ontology" in the context menu of an ontology element or 
a class element in the Ontology Navigator.

<h5>Functions:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Display of classes, individuals and inheritance hierarchy by directed graphs</li>
<li>Display of object properties, data properties and values by directed graphs</li>
<li>Zoom function</li>
<li>Rotation function</li>
<li>Automatic layout for optimized view of the graph</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to use the visualizer?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Left-clicking an element in the Ontology Visualizer will refresh the visualization rendering with 
the currently selected element becoming its center. 
</li>
<li>By right-clicking an element all of its connections will be added 
to the current visualization without shifting the focus to this element.
</li>
<li>In case there are many instances or classes displayed, the visualizer gets quite cluttered, i.e. 
you should avoid visualizing large ontologies with it.
</li>
<li>On the left side of the view a legend is displayed.  Here you can activate or deactivate different ontology 
	entities by selecting the check boxes. 
</li>
<li>You can also enlarge or reduce the view of the graph. 
	This can be achieved by changing the zoom value or by pressing Ctrl/+ 
	to zoom in and Ctrl/- to zoom out.
</li>
<li>The context menu of the visualizer panel provides means for stopping and starting the layout engine, which helps
    when you want to manually arrange the nodes on the screen.
</li>
<li>Also, in the context menu you can find the functionality to rotate the whole graph, which sometimes
	improves the overall layout.
</li>
</ul>


<h5>Graph elements:</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Grey arrows:<br>
Represent the connection between super and subclasses or between a class and its ontology.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Blue arrows:<br>
Represent the connection between classes and their individuals, and between individuals and their properties.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Green arrows:<br>
The values of object properties are connected to the object property via green links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
