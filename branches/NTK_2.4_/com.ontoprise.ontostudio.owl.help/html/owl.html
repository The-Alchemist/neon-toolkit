<h4>OWL</h4>

<p>The Web Ontology Language OWL is used for publishing and sharing ontologies on the World Wide Web,
and is endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium. 
OWL 2 was released as a Recommendation in October 2009.
OWL is considered one of the fundamental technologies underpinning the 
Semantic Web and is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just 
presenting information to humans. Among other things, OWL facilitates greater expressivity
than XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics.</p>

<hr>
<b>Note &ndash; </b>Familiarity with the OWL language specification is recommended to use all features 
of the OWL Perpective. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-primer-20091027/"> OWL 2 Web Ontology 
Language Primer</a>. 
The full set of documents which represent the OWL 2 language definition can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-primer-20091027/">OWL 2 Working Group page</a> the W3C.

<p>This guide contains a brief and informal description of the OWL language constructs and is meant to serve as a reference
for users who want to build ontologies using OWL.</p>

<p>
The 
<a href="owl2-features.html">following page</a> 
we give an overview over all available OWL 2 language features 
and indicate if an how you can to find, access, and enter them in the NeOn Toolkit.
