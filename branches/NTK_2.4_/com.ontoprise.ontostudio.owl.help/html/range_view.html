<h4>Range View</h4>

<p>
The Range View is a view of the OWL Perspective and part of the core of the NeOn Toolkit. 
The Range View displays all properties, which do have the selected Entity as range. 
This view is similar to the <a href="domain_view.html">Domain View</a>. </p>

<p>In the screen shot 1 the class "Location" is in the <a href="ontology_navigator.html">Ontology Navigator</a> 
selected and the Range View displays a list of all properties, which do have the range "Location". In screen shot 2 you can see how it looks 
like, if you select an data type.
Selecting a property from the list will display its details in the <a href="owl_individuals.html">Entity Properties panel</a> on the 
right part of the screen.
